* PC6-9 are used as input and connected to the columns. Pull-up
resistors are * enabled so when the keys are not pressed, these pins
are pulled high. * PC4-7 are used as output that drives the keypad
rows.
* First, all rows are driven low and the input pins are read. If no
key is * pressed, they will read as all one because of the pull up
resistors. * If they are not all one, some key is pressed.
* If some key is pressed, the program proceeds to drive only one row
low at * a time and leave the rest of the rows inactive (float) then
read the input pins. * Knowing which row is active and which column
is active, the program can decide * which key is pressed.
